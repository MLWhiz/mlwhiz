ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Rahul Agarwal, and I run mlwhiz. That includes the [MLWhiz.com](mlwhiz.com), and my [Medium](https://mlwhiz.medium.com/) account.

Using my blogs, I aim to help those who are new to Machine learning and Data science, those who have taken a self-learning route like myself and those who are even vaguely interested in diving in the beautiful world of Maths and Machine Learning. 

I do so by providing structured, method-oriented and simple to follow blogs that don't get lost in technical translation and help the reader understand concepts in a much coherent way. 

All of my blogs are completely free on my site and medium account. But you can still support me using Ko-fi:

:cyclone: I am currently working with Roku and previously worked with Facebook, Walmart and CitiBank as a Machine Learning Engineer and a Data Scientist.
