When we create our machine learning models, a common task that falls on us is how to tune them.

People end up taking different manual approaches. Some of them work, and some don’t, and a lot of time is spent in anticipation and running the code again and again.

***So that brings us to the quintessential question: Can we automate this process?***

A while back, I was working on an in-class competition from the [**“How to win a data science competition”**](https://imp.i384100.net/kjX9md) Coursera course. Learned a lot of new things, one among them being Hyperopt — A bayesian Parameter Tuning Framework.

And I was amazed. I left my Mac with hyperopt in the night. And in the morning I had my results. It was awesome, and I did avoid a lot of hit and trial.

## So, What is Hyperopt?

![](/images/hyperopt2/2.jpg)

From the Hyperopt site:

> *Hyperopt is a Python library for serial and parallel optimization over awkward search spaces, which may include real-valued, discrete, and conditional dimensions*

***In simple terms, this means that we get an optimizer that could minimize/maximize any function for us.*** For example, we can use this to minimize the log loss or maximize accuracy.

All of us know how grid search or random-grid search works.

A grid search goes through the parameters one by one, while a random search goes through the parameters randomly.

***Hyperopt takes as an input space of hyperparameters in which it will search and moves according to the result of past trials.***

> Thus, Hyperopt aims to search the parameter space in an informed way.

I won’t go in the details. But if you want to know more about how it works, take a look at this [**paper**](https://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2013/pdfs/bergstra_hyperopt.pdf) by J Bergstra. Here is the [**documentation**](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt/wiki/FMin) from Github.

## Our Dataset

To explain how hyperopt works, I will be working on the [heart dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) from UCI precisely because it is a simple dataset. And why not do some good using Data Science apart from just generating profits?

This dataset predicts the presence of a heart disease given some variables.

This is a snapshot of the dataset :

This is how the target distribution looks like:

## Hyperopt Step by Step

![](/images/hyperopt2/5.jpg)

So, while trying to run hyperopt, we will need to create two Python objects:

1. ***An Objective function:*** The objective function takes the hyperparameter space as the input and returns the loss. Here we call our objective function `objective`

1. ***A dictionary of hyperparams:*** We will define a hyperparam space by using the variable `space` which is actually just a dictionary. We could choose different distributions for different hyperparameter values.

In the end, we will use the `fmin` function from the hyperopt package to minimize our `objective` through the `space`.

You can follow along with the code in this [Kaggle Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/mlwhiz/how-to-use-hyperopt?scriptVersionId=20362799).

### 1. Create the objective function

Here we create an objective function which takes as input a hyperparameter space:

* We first define a classifier, in this case, XGBoost. Just try to see how we access the parameters from the space. For example `space[‘max_depth’]`

* We fit the classifier to the train data and then predict on the cross-validation set.

* We calculate the required metric we want to maximize or minimize.

* Since we only minimize using `fmin` in hyperopt, if we want to minimize `logloss` we just send our metric as is. If we want to maximize accuracy we will try to minimize `-accuracy`

```py
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from hyperopt import hp, fmin, tpe, STATUS_OK, Trials
import numpy as np
import xgboost as xgb
def objective(space):
    # Instantiate the classifier
    clf = xgb.XGBClassifier(n_estimators =1000,colsample_bytree=space['colsample_bytree'],
                           learning_rate = .3,
                            max_depth = int(space['max_depth']),
                            min_child_weight = space['min_child_weight'],
                            subsample = space['subsample'],
                           gamma = space['gamma'],
                           reg_lambda = space['reg_lambda'])

    eval_set  = [( X, y), ( Xcv, ycv)]

    # Fit the classsifier
    clf.fit(X, y,
            eval_set=eval_set, eval_metric="rmse",
            early_stopping_rounds=10,verbose=False)

    # Predict on Cross Validation data
    pred = clf.predict(Xcv)

    # Calculate our Metric - accuracy
    accuracy = accuracy_score(ycv, pred>0.5)
# return needs to be in this below format. We use negative of accuracy since we want to maximize it.
    return {'loss': -accuracy, 'status': STATUS_OK }
```

### 2. Create the Space for your classifier

![](/images/hyperopt2/6.jpg)

Now, we ***create the search space for hyperparameters*** for our classifier.

To do this, we end up using many of hyperopt built-in functions which define various distributions.

As you can see in the code below, we use uniform distribution between 0.7 and 1 for our `subsample` hyperparameter. We also give a label for the subsample parameter `x_subsample`. You need to provide different labels for each hyperparam you define. I generally add a `x_` before my parameter name to create this label.

```py

space ={'max_depth': hp.quniform("x_max_depth", 4, 16, 1),
        'min_child_weight': hp.quniform ('x_min_child', 1, 10, 1),
        'subsample': hp.uniform ('x_subsample', 0.7, 1),
        'gamma' : hp.uniform ('x_gamma', 0.1,0.5),
        'colsample_bytree' : hp.uniform ('x_colsample_bytree', 0.7,1),
        'reg_lambda' : hp.uniform ('x_reg_lambda', 0,1)
    }
```

You can also define a lot of other distributions too. Some of the most useful stochastic expressions currently recognized by hyperopt’s optimization algorithms are:

* `hp.choice(label, options)` — Returns one of the options, which should be a list or tuple.

* `hp.randint(label, upper)` — Returns a random integer in the range [0, upper).

* `hp.uniform(label, low, high)` — Returns a value uniformly between low and high.

* `hp.quniform(label, low, high, q)` — Returns a value like round(uniform(low, high) / q) * q

* `hp.normal(label, mu, sigma)` — Returns a real value that’s normally-distributed with mean mu and standard deviation sigma.

There are a lot of other distributions. You can check them out [here](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt/wiki/FMin).

### 3. And finally, Run Hyperopt

![](/images/hyperopt2/7.jpg)

Once we run this, we get the best parameters for our model. Turns out we achieved an accuracy of 90% by just doing this on the problem.

```py
trials = Trials()
best = fmin(fn=objective,
            space=space,
            algo=tpe.suggest,
            max_evals=10,
            trials=trials)
print(best)
```

![](/images/hyperopt2/8.png)

***Now we can retrain our XGboost algorithm with these best params, and we are done.***

---

## Conclusion

Running the above gives us pretty good hyperparams for our learning algorithm. And that saves me a lot of time to think about various other hypotheses and testing them.

I tend to use this a lot while tuning my models. ***From my experience, the most crucial part in this whole procedure is setting up the hyperparameter space, and that comes by experience as well as knowledge about the models.***

So, Hyperopt is an awesome tool to have in your repository but never neglect to understand what your models does. It will be very helpful in the long run.

## Continue Learning

Also, if you want to learn about Spark and Spark DataFrames, I would like to call out an excellent course on [Big Data Essentials: HDFS, MapReduce and Spark RDD](https://imp.i384100.net/555ALj) on Coursera.

There is also another framework called as Optuna that you could use as a substitute to Hyperopt. Read about it [here](https://neptune.ai/blog/optuna-vs-hyperopt).

Thanks for the read. I am going to be writing more beginner-friendly posts in the future too. Follow me up at [Medium](https://mlwhiz.medium.com/?source=post_page---------------------------) or Subscribe to my [blog](mlwhiz.com).
