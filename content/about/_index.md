I’m a data scientist consultant and big data engineer based in London, where I am currently working with **Facebook** .

Previously, I have worked at startups like **Fractal** and **MyCityWay** and coglomerates like **Citi**.I Started this blog with a purpose to augment my own understanding about new things while helping others learn about them. I also write for publications on Medium like [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) and [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/)

As Feynman said: **"I couldn't do it. I couldn't reduce it to the freshman level. That means we don't really understand it"**

## Development tools

Personally I am tool agnostic. I like learning new tools and constantly work to add up new skills as I face new problems that cannot be accomplished with my current set of techniques. But the tools that get most of my work done currently are Python, Hadoop and Spark.

I also really like working with data intensive problems and am constantly in search for new ideas to work on.
