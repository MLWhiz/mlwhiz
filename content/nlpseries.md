		Recently, I started up with an NLP competition on Kaggle called Quora Question insincerity challenge. It is an NLP Challenge on text classification and as the problem has become more clear after working through the competition as well as by going through the invaluable kernels put up by the kaggle experts, I thought of sharing the knowledge.
Since we have a large amount of material to cover, I am splitting this post into a series of posts.

		This is the second post of the NLP Text classification series. To give you a recap, recently I started up with an NLP text classification competition on Kaggle called Quora Question insincerity challenge. And I thought to share the knowledge via a series of blog posts on text classification. The first post talked about the various preprocessing techniques that work with Deep learning models and increasing embeddings coverage. In this post, I will try to take you through some basic conventional models like TFIDF, Count Vectorizer, Hashing etc.

		Kaggle is an excellent place for learning. And I learned a lot of things from the recently concluded competition on Quora Insincere questions classification in which I got a rank of 182/4037. In this post, I will try to provide a summary of the things I tried. I will also try to summarize the ideas which I missed but were a part of other winning solutions.
As a side note: if you want to know more about NLP, I would like to recommend this awesome course on Natural Language Processing in the Advanced machine learning specialization.

		With the problem of Image Classification is more or less solved by Deep learning, Text Classification is the next new developing theme in deep learning. For those who don&rsquo;t know, Text classification is a common task in natural language processing, which transforms a sequence of text of indefinite length into a category of text. How could you use that?
 To find sentiment of a review. Find toxic comments in a platform like Facebook Find Insincere questions on Quora.

		Chatbots are the in thing now. Every website must implement it. Every Data Scientist must know about them. Anytime we talk about AI; Chatbots must be discussed. But they look intimidating to someone very new to the field. We struggle with a lot of questions before we even begin to start working on them. Are they hard to create? What technologies should I know before attempting to work on them?
