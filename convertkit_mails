A few days ago you signed up for my newsletter and made a great choice trusting me with your inbox, I'm going to continue sending you some great content over the next few months, but first, I want to answer a question that a lot of my readers ask me.

So, I get many questions regarding how I learned Data Science? Or which books I find good? Or how to begin with Machine Learning? It is actually hard for a beginner to go through the plethora of resources that exist on the internet and find the correct ones. So, I thought of sharing the resources I found useful and which I recommend wholeheartedly to my subscribers to make the journey a little easy for them. 
1. ​Machine Learning From Stanford:​ It is the Game Changer Machine Learning course. It contains the maths behind many of the Machine Learning algorithms. I will put this course as the one course you have to take as this course motivated me into getting into this field, and Andrew Ng is a great instructor. Also, this was the first course that I took myself when I started.
2. ​Inferential Statistics:​ Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel teaches this course on Inferential Statistics. And it cannot get simpler than this one. She is a great instructor and explains the fundamentals of Statistical inference nicely — a must-take course. You will learn about hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical inference methods for numerical and categorical data.
3. ​Deep Learning Specialization​: This Deep Learning specialization by deeplearning.ai will help you understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare you to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology. 
I hope you’ll really enjoy learning Data Science. 
Also one more thing it would be great if you could share this newsletter with your friends, colleagues, and people interested in Data Science or Machine Learning. Or they can themselves subscribe to my list using this ​subscription link​. Also, don't worry, it's FREE for everyone.

Want to Learn Big Data?
Big Data has become synonymous with Data engineering. But the line between Data Engineering and Data scientists is blurring day by day. At this point in time, I think that Big Data must be in the repertoire of all Data Scientists.
Reason: Too much data is getting generated day by day
And that brings us to Spark. Now most of the Spark documentation, while good, did not explain it from the perspective of a data scientist.
So, I thought of giving it a shot. This series of posts on Spark is all that is needed to understand and work with Spark. These posts are some of the best content I have ever created so I am really excited about sharing it with you:

1. ​The Hitchhikers guide to handle Big Data using Spark​: In this post, we will learn about Spark Basics - RDD actions and Transformations.
2. ​The Most Complete Guide to pySpark DataFrames​: In this post, I will talk about installing Spark, standard Spark functionalities you will need to work with DataFrames, and finally some tips to handle the inevitable errors you will face.
3. ​Practical Spark Tips for Data Scientists​: Practical Spark and memory management tips for Data Scientists
4. ​Spark 3.0 With GPU on DataProc​: This post is about setting up your own Dataproc Spark Cluster with NVIDIA GPUs on Google Cloud.
Also, if you want to learn more about Spark and Spark DataFrames, and would like to take a Course based approach, 
I would like to call out these excellent courses on Big Data: 
1. ​Big Data Essentials: HDFS, MapReduce, and Spark RDD​ and 
2. ​Big Data ​Graph Analytics
I hope you’ll really enjoy learning about Big Data with these posts and Courses.

Are you a beginner to Data Science?
Don't worry, We have all been there. Not knowing where to start and getting stuck with fairly trivial tasks. So here is where you should start. I will keep this short and provide some good resources to start with data manipulations in this mail.
But before doing anything, you will need to setup your own developmet environment. You can use Atom​(Create an Awesome Development Setup for Data Science using Atom​) or Jupyter Notebooks. I prefer both for certain tasks. When i am working with scripts I use Atom, and whe I have to work with Pandas or Plots, I use Jupyter. For a beginner I would recommed Jupyter Notebooks only.
Once, you are done with Setting up an environment, you need to start working with some data. Doing groupby's, Joins, aggregations etc as well as understanding them. You can do that using Pandas which is one of the best libraries in Python( ​Minimal Pandas Subset for Data Scientists​) Or SQL​(Learning SQL the Hard Way​)
I recommend everyone to learn both Pandas as SQL as they solve most of data manipulation needs and form the backbone of all the different systems we tend to use while working with data be it small data or big data.
Again, if you want to take a course based approach, here are some good courses for ​SQL for Data Science​ and ​Intermediate level Python​ for Pandas.
I hope you’ll really enjoy learning about Manipulating Data with these posts and Courses.

Lately, a lot of folks are asking me questions around how to learn DSA and how to get better at it and crack DSA interviews.


The simplest answer is Practice and Perseverance. I remember practising almost 100 problems before appearing for my data structure coding rounds and I still felt that it was not enough. People who were selected with me had done as many as "500 Leetcodes" as they like to say it.
That said a comprehensive plan to study is also pretty important here. Here are my suggestions to crack almost any coding interview:


Read up "​Cracking the Coding Interview"​ book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.Focus on simple Data Structures like Array, Sets, Stack/Queue, Hashmap/Dictionary, Tree/Binary Tree, Heap, Graphs without worrying too much about more advanced Data structures like AVL or Red-Black trees.Get a hold of these common algorithms: Divide-and-Conquer, DP/memoization, Recursion, Binary Search, BFS/DFS, Tree traversals.Practice a lot of problems on a platform like Leetcode.
Also for me, the following step by step procedure worked:
Understand the problem by asking the interviewer more about it.Keep the interviewer involved in what you are thinkingCome up with a Naive solution in most casesTry to find a better solution by thinking about which algorithm or data structure might fit the problem.
Apart from this have a look at some of the posts I have written on some of these algorithms and data structures:


​A simple introduction to Linked Lists for Data Scientists​​3 Programming concepts for Data Scientists​ — Recursion/Memoization, DP and Binary Search​Dynamic Programming for Data Scientists​​Handling Trees in Data Science Algorithmic Interview​
If you would like to take a course approach have a look at ​Algorithm Specialization on Coursera by UCSanDiego​.

Let me tell you a story. 
It was 2013, and I was struggling to decide what I wanted to do in my career. 
I was frigging so confused. Should I do an MBA, or keep on being a Business analyst? After all, how much SQL can a guy write? (The answer to this is - Not enough my friend :P ).
​
And, at this time I found the Machine Learning course from Andrew Ng, and I was instantly hooked. It felt like he was doing some magic with Maths. And now, 8 Years later, I am still hooked to machine learning and whenever someone asks me where to start their ML Journey, I wholeheartedly direct them towards this course.
​
But, though the course was pretty great at explaining basics of machine learning, the course was getting somewhat out of touch in 2022. Learning Octave just for this course, no focus on Tree based methods and not any focus on current DL frameworks were some of the problems that the course had.
​
Not Now though.
​
I am excited to announce that Andrew Ng’s new Machine Learning Specialization from DeepLearning.AI and Stanford University just launched. This Specialization summarizes the advances made over the ten years since the original course was released and includes:
Graded assignments and lectures that teach Python instead of Octave/Matlab.3 in-depth courses providing a broad introduction to machine learning, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning.Dozens of additional code notebooks and interactive graphs to help learners better understand concepts.

I am so excited to take this one again. Are you?

When we prepare for jobs, we start thinking about it in nearly a very simplistic manner. I mean we think about preparing for a job and then only applying. And we never do prepare anything. And thus never apply, getting comfortable with our current “situation”.

This is not how it should work. The decision to change a job needs to come from within first and then you need to ask the question to yourself:

What do I need from my next stint?

Is it leadership opportunity, more scope, domain switch or anything else? There wont be a simple answer to it and it will be personal to everyone.

Once you get the answer, think of how you will achieve such a goal and start preparing for it.

Meanwhile you also need to apply for such positions. Don’t wait to be prepared. Never will come such a time. Go to linkedin, contact recruiters, ask for referrals from your connections. Fail a few interviews. Keep on preparing even more by learning from failures. Worst that could happen is that you can apply again into the failed role after 6 months. And that is still not a failure. You would know about the process and would have eome sort of relationship with the recruiter too. So it is all good. In time it will come.

Now for a few generic tips:

1. DSA is important for a lot of jobs but that is not the whole of it. Get to an average level in solving those medium level leetcode problems and just move on. Most of the companies are not looking for competitive programming level stuff. Even FAANGs. If you want to read my Interview experience at FB: ​https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-cracked-my-mle-interview-at-facebook-fe55726f0096​

2. There is a common misconception that behavioural interviews are not that important and if you do the tech rounds well you are through. I would suggest preparing well for behavioural and design interviews. Many a times i have seen people being rejected or downlevelled due to them.

3. Don’t specialize. Or if you do, specialize but know your basics well too. Talking about deep learning and not being able to answer a simple question about logistic regression doesn’t put you in a good light. Remember that until you are applying for a very specialised role your interviewer might not know what to ask you if you only focus on some obscure topic.

4. Research. Each company has a structure for interviews. Understand that structure well. Try to Minimise surprises on interviewing day. Ask your recruiter about the process. Dont be shy to do that.
