# My Data Science Open Degree:

With the advent of **MOOC** and various forums for learning like the **OCW**, **edX** and **Coursera**, I could not stop myself from getting a second education (<am>that too at no cost</em>). 
Although there are many critics of MOOC, I believe that they work if they are undertaken with proper motivation. In a sense I find them better than a classroom course as I might miss a classroom lecture but I rarely ever skip an online video when I am motivated enough to take the course online. 

So moving on, I was always interested in Computer Science, and Open source Courses have provided me a way to learn.
What follows is my own <u><em>**Data science Masters curriculum**</em></u>. This is aimed at **Computer Science** with a **Specialization in Machine Learning**.

My main aim here is to learn about **Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science and Machine Learning**, though not necessarily in the same order.
The Certificates for **courses which grant certificates** are at [HERE](https://github.com/MLWhiz/Certificates)

## My Own Data Science Curriculum

I have categorized the courses here as of **two types**:
+ F - <u>**Foundational**</u> Class
+ A - <u>**Advanced**</u> Specialization

### Mathematics
####**<u>(F1) Linear Algebra By Gilbert Strang - MIT OCW</u>**
A Great Class by a great Teacher. I Would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn LA. 
The Main Topic Covered in this class are :
- 

####**<u>(F2) Multivariate Calculus - MIT OCW - TODO</u>**


### Computer Science
####**<u>(F1) CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science, Harvard</u>**
This is an Introduction to Computer Science class taken by David Malan. Helped me with many misunderstandings and helped build intuition around the whole CS playground. Starts with a basic introduction to C and some programming exercises. Ends up teaching basics of PHP, Javascript and HTML/CSS as well. The projects in this class are really awesome. The github code repository for this class is at [HERE](https://github.com/MLWhiz/CS50)

####**<u>(F2) CS101x : MITx introduction to programming using Python</u>**
The course is an introduction to many of the important concepts in computer science.
Talks about simple algorithms, Asymptotic times, Classes, OOP, Trees, Exceptions, Assertions, Hashing and a whole lot of other stuff.

####**<u>(F3) Algorithms and Data Structures - TODO- MITx</u>**

####**<u> (F4) RICE University : Comp Sci Mini Specialization - </u>**

This is a series of **6 short but good courses**. The lectures are good but the problems and assignments are awesome. It consists of three main courses:
######[Interactive Programming in Python](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython1): 
The Course starts with teaching Python but suddenly moves into creating graphical user interfaces and games using python in codeskulptor. I created some very basic games in this course. Some of them are:

* [Guess The Number](https://github.com/MLWhiz/RICE/tree/master/IPP-RICE/1_Guess_The_Number)
* [StopWatch](https://github.com/MLWhiz/RICE/tree/master/IPP-RICE/2_StopWatch)
* [Pong](https://github.com/MLWhiz/RICE/tree/master/IPP-RICE/3_Pong)
* [Memory](https://github.com/MLWhiz/RICE/tree/master/IPP-RICE/4_Memory)
* [BlackJack](https://github.com/MLWhiz/RICE/tree/master/IPP-RICE/5_BlackJack)
* [RiceRocks](https://github.com/MLWhiz/RICE/tree/master/IPP-RICE/6_Spaceship)

######[Principles of Computing](https://www.coursera.org/course/principlescomputing1): 
This course adds on to the previous course but here the focus is more on thinking programatically rather than GUIs. The projects are really great as the course progresses with creating games. 

- [Solitaire Mancala](https://github.com/MLWhiz/RICE/tree/master/POC-RICE/1_SolitaireMancala)
- [2048](https://github.com/MLWhiz/RICE/tree/master/POC-RICE/2_2048)
- [Tic Tac Toe Using Monte Carlo](https://github.com/MLWhiz/RICE/tree/master/POC-RICE/3_TicTacToe_MonteCarlo)
- [Yahtzee](https://github.com/MLWhiz/RICE/tree/master/POC-RICE/4_yahtzee)
- [Cookie Clicker](https://github.com/MLWhiz/RICE/tree/master/POC-RICE/5_cookie)
- [Zombie Apocalypse](https://github.com/MLWhiz/RICE/tree/master/POC-RICE/6_Zombie_Apocalypse)
- [Word Wrangler](https://github.com/MLWhiz/RICE/tree/master/POC-RICE/7_Word_Wrangler)
- [Tic Tac Toe Using Minimax](https://github.com/MLWhiz/RICE/tree/master/POC-RICE/8_Tic_Tac_Toe_Minimax)
- [Fifteen Puzzle](https://github.com/MLWhiz/RICE/tree/master/POC-RICE/9_Fifteen)

###### [Algorithmic Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/course/algorithmicthink1): 
This course starts with a focus on graph algorithms and data structures. 
The codes are sourced at [Github](https://github.com/MLWhiz/RICE/tree/master/AT-RICE)

### Statistics:

####**<u> (F1) Stat 110: Introduction to Probability: Joe Blitzstein - Harvard University</u>**
<!-- ![](http://static.projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/styles/os_files_xxlarge/public/stat110/files/stat110picture_3.png?itok=43A3HUO3) -->
> Conditioning is the Soul fo Statistics.∫

I took this course to enhance my understanding of <u>probability distributions and statistics</u>, but this course taught me a lot more than that. Apart fom Learning to **think conditionally**, this also taught me how to explain difficult concepts with a story.

This was a **Hard Class** but **definitely fun**. The focus was not only on getting Mathematical proofs but also on understanding the intuition behind them and how intuition can help in deriving them more easily.Sometimes the same proof was done in different ways to facilitate learning of a concept.

One of the things I liked most about this course is the focus on concrete examples while explaining abstract concepts. The inclusion of <u>**Gambler's Ruin Problem, Matching Problem, Birthday Problem, Monty Hall, Simpsons Paradox, St. Petersberg Paradox**</u> etc. made this course much much more exciting than a normal Statistics Course.

I will Definitely be on a lookut for more courses by Joe after this and I have already done one more course by him - CS109. More on that later.

The **Top 10 Ideas** covered in this class are:

1) Probability, Conditioning is the soul of Statistics, **Story Proofs**
2) Bayes Theorum, **Law of Total Probability**, **First Step Analysis**. 
3) **Expectation** and **Variance** for discrete RVs and continuous RVs. **LOTUS**.
4) Discrete (Bernoulli, Binomial, Hypergeometric, Geometric, Negative Binomial, FS, Poisson) and Continuous (Uniform, Normal, expo, Beta, Gamma) Distributions and the stories behind them.
5) Moment Generating Functions(MGF's) and their Properties
6) Joint and Marginal distributions, Covariance and Correlation
7) Convolutions and Transformations
8) Conditional Expectation - Adam and Eve Law
9) Law of Large Numbers and CLT
10) Markov Chains

I watched the <u>[lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo)</u> and read the <u>[book](http://www.amazon.in/Introduction-Probability-Chapman-Statistical-Science/dp/1466575573)</u> to get a deep understanding of the material.

I also wrote two Blog posts on Basics and Applications of MCMC using learnings from this course.

(F3) Statistical Inference: Duke University - Done

### Distributed and Parallel Computing
####**<u>(A1) BerkeleyX: CS100.1x Introduction to Big Data with Apache Spark and (A2) BerkeleyX: CS190.1x Scalable Machine Learning</u>**

> A mighty flame followeth a tiny spark.

This is a series of courses in Spark taught by [Anthony D. Joseph](https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS100.1x/1T2015/fbe63aa3c95948e3912fa128aedec27d/),a Professor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley and [Ameet Talwalkar](https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS190.1x/1T2015/info), a well known name in Spark community.
This course delivers on what it says. It teaches Spark. Total beginners will have difficulty following the course as the course progresses very fast. That said anyone with a decent understanding of how big data works will be OK.

1) **RDD Transformations** (map, flatmap, filter, distinct, groupByKey, sortByKey, reduceByKey)
2) **RDD Actions** (reduce, takeOrdered, take, collect)
3) **Accumulator** and **BroadCast Variables**
4) [Dataframe in pySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html)
5) SQL on paired RDDs - leftOuterJoin, rightOuterJoin, fullOuterJoin

I certainly liked the Mini Projects in the class:
1) [Wordcount in Spark](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/MLWhiz/Spark_Projects/blob/master/1_Word_count/lab1_word_count_student.ipynb) - A word counting program to count the words in all of Shakespeare's plays

####**<u>(A3) Hadoop Mapreduce - Udacity</u>**

Very Easy Course. Taught the Fundamentals of Hadoop streaming with Python taken by Cloudera on Udacity. I am doing much more advanced stuff with python and mapreduce now but this is one of the courses that laid the foundation there.


### Machine Learning


(F) CS109:             			- Mid 
(F) CS229: Andrew Ng   			- TODO
####**<u>(F1) MITx The Analytics Edge </u>**
This is a fantastic course for learning about R as well as the implementations of various machine learning algorithm in R. Very Basic. Very Crisp and very informative. The scenarios and examples range from Moneyball to Watson. The only problem with this  course is that it's problem sets feel a little repetitive. 
Here is the [location](https://github.com/MLWhiz/R-Codes) of my R code repository for this course

####**<u>(F2) Intro to Data Science -University of Washington </u>**
